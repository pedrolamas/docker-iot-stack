This is my personal Docker IoT Stack configuration, currently up and running inside a [NanoPi M4V2](https://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=180) small board computer (SBC) with a Sabrent 256GB Rocket NVMe PCIe M.2 2280 SSD.

The NanoPI is running the latest [Armbian OS](https://www.armbian.com/nanopi-m4-v2/).

To install docker, please use the [convenience script](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script).

To run, just enter the root folder and run:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
